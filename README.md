# chat-app

Based on Andrew Mead's [Complete Node.js Developer Course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2/), I developed this chat application.
This repo is used purely for learning exercises and the course content should not be interpreted as something I've created on my own.
It uses the Socket.IO library to allow users to join particular rooms and chat with other users within those rooms.
